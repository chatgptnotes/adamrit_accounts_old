-- The claim never actually claimed anything.
--
-- submit_cash_handover expanded the preview's line list with
--   jsonb_to_recordset(...) AS x(tbl TEXT, id TEXT, ...)
-- but the preview writes the key as "table", not "tbl". jsonb_to_recordset
-- matches on column NAME, so x.tbl was NULL on every row, and the guard
--   WHERE x.tbl <> 'payment_vouchers'
-- is NULL <> 'payment_vouchers' -> NULL -> not true, so ZERO rows were
-- inserted into cash_handover_sources and no receipt was ever stamped.
--
-- The effect: a handover recorded a counted amount and claimed nothing. The
-- same cash could be handed over again the next hour, by anyone, because the
-- receipts still looked unclaimed -- which is exactly the double-handover the
-- unique index was meant to make impossible.
--
-- Caught by an end-to-end pharmacy test: 470 counted, sourceCount 0, and the
-- till still reading 470 afterwards.
--
-- "table" is a reserved word, so it is quoted rather than renamed; the key
-- name is part of the shape the tablet already reads.
